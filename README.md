## Why are you making this?
My reasoning behind making, yet another, long-winded, highly autistic document like this is to provide both myself and others an overview of the current drama effecting the North American version of TERA Online. I get that nobody wants to read this shit, I don't either and probably wont even proofread this. 

However I don't really care because I feel as if I need to put something like this out there, especially considering that I will be releasing a minor exploit along with this (the calendar item bug). This will hopefully illuminate the reasoning why I took this approach and hopefully clear up some of the misinformation circulating around regarding this and other dramas.

## Whomst've are you?
 Hi I'm HugeDong69/Codeagon, I write horrific exploit mods for TERA-Online like [FPS-UTILS](https://github.com/codeagon/fps-utils), a mod to help players gain more FPS ingame, [Astral-TERA](https://github.com/codeagon/Astral-TERA), a mod to do the unthinkable evil of letting players communicate across servers (and soon have player houses), and many more terrible, horribly game destroying mods.
 
 I have been modding TERA since May 21, 2017, when I released my first mod, [Puberty](https://github.com/codeagon/Puberty), a very silly and simple mod that changes your characters voice with a command.
 
I also told the public about an [incredibly](https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/11/tera-mmo-chat-vulnerability/) [dangerous](https://kotaku.com/mmo-disables-chat-after-players-discover-it-could-be-us-1820345684) [vulnerability](https://www.pcgamesn.com/tera/tera-malware-exploit) in the chat of TERA after being banned from EMEs discord while trying to get in touch with a staff member about it. And in a shocking twist, history is repeating itself with the item duplication bug recently.

## Communication Breakdown

TERA-Online is a game that I truly love, however the constant mismanagement of the game by En Masse Entertainment has resulted in much frustration for myself and others over the years. Drama after drama they show that they are either unwilling to or unable to listen to their community or act in their communities best interests. The main reason behind their failures in this regard, in my opinion, is their lack of communication. Something that you'll see I repeat a lot here is that the solution to the issue could have been to talk to someone, whether that be modders or their own community.

The original drama with proxy was the first instance of this, being that members of the modding community had their accounts banned, despite never exploiting in-game or negatively impacting the game. Instead of contacting the developers, they decided to ban them instead. I highly recommend reading[ Meishu's post about this, as it's more informed and well written than anything I could do](https://komyou.tumblr.com/post/160137405860/part-1-the-history-a-timeline). If EME had instead talked to them or asked them to either limit or take down the project, I believe they would have complied, and this still rings true today. If EME wants me to take my mods down completely, I will, without hesitation, despite how bad that would look for the both of us (considering all of my mods are fairly tame shit and completely client-sided)

## Memeboi and the funky dognose
I thought this would be important to bring up in order to make a point, when Memeboi posted a screenshot of themselves with 99999999 reward credits (that were completely clientside) and told people that you could buy items in the reward store from tiers above your own (surprisingly again, not using proxy to do this), EME issued a fix within 24 hours of a screenshot being made and posted. Keep this in mind as you read ahead, especially during the [Chat RCE](#chat-rce-drama) section.

## Memeslash and open world dungeons

Skipping a few minor things, next up is the Memeslash and infinite dungeon runs drama. This is the main point a lot of anti-proxy people talk about, and I can understand why. Memeslash was a huge issue that, for some reason, took months to resolve. On EME's behalf, their handling of it was less that stellar for several reasons. Firstly, it took them forever and a day to implement a simple packet rate check, something that Gameforge, the European publisher of TERA, added incredibly quickly in comparison.

But wait, those dang dirty proxy people unleashed this on the world, memeslash didn't exist before this, right? Wrong. Despite not being in the public eye, memeslash had been used (and in a lesser extent is still used through another exploit) for YEARS prior to it become public knowledge, before proxy even existed. Proxy had nothing to do with the original memeslash, and anything proxy can do, memory editing can accomplish far, far more easily.

But wait, those dang proxy people publicized it and profited from it! Also wrong, anyone selling memeslash was ostracized from the development community and banned from all discords related to it as well as anyone talking about any exploit of any kind (which was always and is still the case). Not only this, but the opcode (the thing needed for proxy to run the memeslash script) was removed from proxy. But wait, there's more.

 Several proxy devs also took to banning players themselves, since EME was letting people run free with this script, potentially gaining millions of gold in the process. How? By teleporting them to an invalid zone(doomzone), which would effectively lock their character. What did EME do when faced with support tickets asking to be teleported out of this zone? They of course, being sensible, teleported them out without a second word.
 
 Not only this, but Saegusa (a proxy developer) handed them a list of the coordinates and times at which people were abusing this, as well as a **very detailed** writeup (on two separate occasions) of how these exploits were done and what they could do about it on a silver platter, only for them to do what they do best, banned him for it. 
 
 Imagine for a moment if EME had instead worked with proxy developers to ban these players. Or better yet, listened to the masses of tickets reporting the bug to them before it release to the public, and attempted to fix it. Seems like a sensible thing to do, except this is EME we're talking about. 

## Chat RCE Drama
The chat RCE drama was fairly big deal at the time. If you want a big ol' writeup of that situation, [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1reZz6MGHQg_IFUfX__knCQVkvbDnGv384Afj1E3QU6E/edit), or google "Tera chat", or for a more technical writeup, [here](https://neowutran.ovh/others/Tera-chat-exploit.pdf). The main takeaway of this, and how it comes into play with the recent issues, is EMEs poor communication in that matter, particularly when players safety is at risk. 

Something that I (think, I didn't actually re-read the google doc because fuck that) talk about in the document is how hard it was to contact EME, but I don't believe I fully went into detail about just how much of an ordeal it was. Initially I went into the EME discord to attempt to contact them about it and was banned after being a twit about it, that much everyone knows. What some people don't know is that this issue had been reported previously to EME and BHS. Multiple times. By multiple people. For literal years. It was also being used on EU prior to me making the post, in order to post NSFW images in global chat, and talk in less-than-scrupulous discord were already happening about the implications of this.

Then, after I made my Reddit post, detailing the issue and warning players about it, I attempted to contact EME again, this time through other players. I wont name names but these people were in direct contact with EME at the time and were the **only** reason I was able to contact EME at all. I heard nothing for 4+ days from EME, eventually being tossed and email to contact myself from these players. Why not discord? Don't EME use discord? Weren't there multiple staff members talking there and banning people bringing the issue up at the time? Why did it take 4 fucking days to contact me? Why did I have to go through a third party to talk to anyone from your company? No clue, maybe by the time they decided to contact me, articles were being written and they figured, fuck it, might as well try and fix this. Who the fuck knows.

Then there was the "fix", or rather, the partial disabling of a select few chat channels but not the one channel that is sent to everyone, regardless of if they enable it or not, megaphone (still usable on NA despite there being no item for it), and not every single chat channel (IIRC things like the emotes, guild chat, whispers etc were still able to be sent). [Here](https://i.imgur.com/QjESUnv.png) are the emails I sent regarding this. 

As you can see, EME were aware players were at risk still, and did uhhhHHHHHHH... nothing. At this time, might I point out, they had their weekly livestream. Did they address the chat being disabled at all, in the slightest? **No. Not at all**. Did they tell players, at any stage of this event, that they were still vulnerable. **No. Not once**. Please do not forget that they pulled this and have still never really addressed it.

## Fraudulent DMCA's
The most recent chapter in EMEs history of fucking things up, was the fraudulent Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims made against[ several TERA-Proxy repositories on Github](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/45b77d28d13c630ccd5c548d5a98c78ad297c5fd/2018/2018-09-28-TeraPC.md).  To explain briefly what a DMCA claim is, you are essentially saying that a piece of work is either in full or contains a substantive part,  of your own work. Essentially EME is claiming that they own part of, or in full, the repositories that were linked. Which is hilarious considering some aren't even proxy related, and some of the included things are mods such as one to notify the player when a skill reset, a feature TERA is lacking. Submitting a false DMCA claim, by the way, **is a crime**.

I say fraudulent for several reasons. Firstly, there are mistakes in the document, namely [this line ](https://i.imgur.com/dICYvDG.png) wherein they fail to accurately affirm that they have read and understood Github's guide for DMCA notice submittal.

Secondly, and more importantly, is that the claim is entirely baseless. The repositories in question contain no code used by EME, and contain no materials that are their intellectual property. Unless EME developed proxy??? (plot twist) and [this module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/process-list)????. You might argue that the opcode names are their property, however if EME had read either [the act itself ](https://www.aclu.org/other/text-digital-millennium-copyright-act-dmca) or[ Githubs own guidelines to which they kinda sorta agreed to](https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/), they would have noticed that data/names are not subject to copyright, only the expression of that information is.

The fact that they used the DMCA system shows how little of a fuck they give, because I'm sure they know that nobody is going to go up against a multi-million dollar company in order to countersue them for abusing the system. I however don't understand why they didn't just file a [github abuse report](https://github.com/contact/report-abuse) instead. Perhaps they did and it was denied. Who knows. I also don't understand why they didn't just fucking ask the developers to take it down, seeing as they've stated they would have complied. I guess that would require communication, which EME is incapable of, my mistake.

## Managing communities 101
It's no secret, [EME suck at managing their player-base](https://i.imgur.com/o6FaALy.jpg). This will be a bit of a rant, so feel free to [skip](#the-ultimatum-dupe-time-bb) this section if that's not your cup of tea, this is mostly for me.

I don't understand EME, I don't understand their thought process when they do things like this, and I don't understand why they keep letting the same mistakes happen. Part of me almost thinks they're trying to piss their community off on purpose at this stage. 

They don't listen to their community, they[ constantly delete](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/246174488809570305/497665371885666304/we_are_listening_to_your_feedback.png) any and all negative post about them, whether it meme or valid criticism, and they make some of the worst decisions imaginable. Why? I have no clue. Absolutely no fucking clue. You would think after the previous drama they would learn from their mistakes and actually listen to their player-base, or even go as far as to reach out to them. No. 

We have the player council, who they don't listen to, and who recently they banned one of the members of for [posting memes about the most recent drama](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/150048025425739777/497268271578611722/Screenshot_20181004-054606_Discord.jpg), despite that accurately summing up the players reaction to this debacle. What's the fucking use of having a "player council" if you don't fucking listen to them and expect them not to act as players, but your own personal mouthpiece to parrot what you want them to. Why have them in the first place if they don't communicate anything to you or anything from you.

Then we get to KitTeaCup, the current community manager for the game. I honestly felt really bad for her, she's fairly new and then this whole thing happened. Except, she's had months to learn the bare minimum about a game whose community she has managing, and hasn't, was suspiciously in the TERA-proxy discord that was taken down, and then you have how she handled the situation. My sympathy is pretty non-existent now.

I wont link the forum posts made by her or go into depth about them, many other people have picked them apart and many other people have pointed out her failings more eloquently than I ever could (see the image linked at the start of this section for one example). One thing I would like to bring attention to is this screenshot, because I feel it highlights some very important points.
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/349833287629406209/497246467782606868/unknown.png)

In this, you see someone upset at the state of the game and the way things were handled, this person is obviously very upset and angry, perhaps even a little mentally unstable or going through a tough time. This much is clear, even to an autistmo like myself. They're being a little rude, saying that she's not a real gamer, which is a little mean, however incredibly accurate given that she knows next to nothing about the game she is **paid through funds given to EME by their community** to manage. Her response, instead of calmly addressing the situation, saying that she understands their frustration with the situation, or any number of canned customer service responses that you would expect from someone **being paid** to interact as a representative of her workplace. Her response was instead, to laugh at the person and give them a standoffish response, linking to a Kotaku article about Sexism.

Real good.

Most fucking McDonalds employees are better at this than her. Get a grip, this is your job. You are paid money to do this from the community you are hired to work with. Act like a fucking professional, get a grip and grow the fuck up, this isn't fucking high-school.

## The ultimatum (Dupe time bb)
Now for the thing you've all been waiting for!
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/350509711562637316/495944862525292564/unknown.png)
Firstly, I'd like to explain _why_ I went about things the way I did in regards to releasing a dupe bug. Initially, I can't lie, I was frustrated and also incredibly inebriated at the time of writing my initial post, however I'm not one to back down from something, as I would've thought EME would have realised from the [past RCE drama](#chat-rce-drama).

I picked the calendar dupe rather than something more damage like one of many skill exploits (memeslash2.0 anyone?), server crashing behaviours, more damaging dupes, etc (the list goes on forever, seemingly despite many of these issues being reported) that I and most other proxy developers know about, for a couple of reasons. The main one, of course, being that it's fairly non damaging, being incredibly limited and also incredibly easy for EME to disable entirely. Make no mistake, while I am incredibly pissed off that things have gone this way, I don't want to kill the region and I certainly don't want to kill the game.

Secondly, this ""dupe"" wasn't exactly a huge secret, many players with high ping, the players most in need of some of the modules proxy offers, would have seen this bug, as well as many people trying to claim items when the servers (still often, despite claims they've fixed it) lags. I also picked this dupe because, once again, it's an issue with the game that isn't made any easier by proxy, but one that could have been fixed by having open communication lines with the proxy developer community.

Thirdly, it's easy to do. All you have to do is download a better version of the game and click a button as fast as EME deletes forum posts they don't agree with, and watch the items roll on in.

Whilst my way of communicating it was admittedly standoffish and could have been done better, I was trying to contact EME regarding a bug in their game, giving them ample time to simply send me a single DM on discord or an email so that I could contact them directly. Emails don't take long to send, and discord messages take even less. But, I knew they wouldn't reach out and contact me, just as they haven't in the past, even if the stakes were an apparent dupe bug.

Their response? ["We're aware and going to take action. Thanks!"](https://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1200/5730046f34ed8fca2e0de4755da23524-png.jpg) I'm still waiting. No doubt it'll be something less than ideal, like a DMCA against my github or a ban off discord, rather than talking to me, keeping with the theme of them being absolute fucking clowns.

I ask you, in what other game could someone reach out to you multiple times about a bug, asking for communication, and then be ignored. In what other game would ANY of the shit talked about in this long ass document be acceptable.

## Closing
I know the vast majority of you haven't read all of this, and I honestly don't blame you, I wouldn't either. There's a lot to read and very little of it makes any fucking sense.

To EME: I give up. You've ruined one of my, and many other players, favourite game through your inability to learn from your past failures and inability to listen to what your community wants. You're killing an already dying game.

For anyone playing on the NA version of the game still, move. **You as players give EME their money, you are paying them or have paid them to do this**. Things are only going to get **worse**, from here on out, just like they have been for years now. En Masse Entertainment wont listen to you, En Masse Entertainment wont do anything sensible. Give up, just like I have. It's hard, and starting fresh on a new server isn't a great time, but trust me when I say it'll be worth it in the long run.

This'll be my last major involvement in any drama related to En Masse Entertainment. I've given them chance after chance, I've waited for things to change, both as a player that has sunk considerable hours and money into the game, and as mod developer that has sunk considerable hours into making the game run smoother, and I've been let down time and time again by En Masse Entertainment, just like the vast majority of the player-base.

Bye, enjoy the dupe. I'm sorry that things turned out this way, truly I did not want  this.
